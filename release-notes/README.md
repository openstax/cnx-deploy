# Release Notes

This directory contains release notes organized by year and month.

The file naming structure here is `year-mon.md`. For example, `2016-apr.md` would be the release for April 2016. If addtional releases are made in a month, just append a number after the month.

## Template

```
# {month} {year} CNX release
