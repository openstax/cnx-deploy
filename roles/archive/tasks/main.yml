# FIXME (11-Feb-2016) Ansible >=2.1.0 required
# In order to use the pip module's ``state: forcereinstall`` option,
# we must upgrade to 2.1.0, which is not release yet.
#
# Using pip's ``--force-reinstall`` & ``--ignore-installed`` options do not
# work because they reinstall **everything**,
# which doesn't work because it tries to install some of our
# unreleased packages and then fails to find them.
#
# The blocks surrounded by ``# XXX`` & ``# /XXX`` should be removed
# as soon as possible. And this FIXME block ends with the closing /FIXME
