# This installs the python packages required for the in-database plpython
# operations.

# FIXME (10-Apr-12017) in-database-logic:
#       The imports are within cnx-archive. In the future this will
#       hopefully be simplified to only install cnx-db.
#       Many of the following tasks are copied directly from the archive
#       role. Compare changes between there and here before debugging.
